I am a Ph.D. candidate in Information Systems and Operations Management at Goizueta Business School of Emory University. My research develops data-driven solutions that improve **customer experience** while maintaining **operational efficiency** in **healthcare** and **retail** domains. My current interests include contextual modeling of patient flow in hospitals, as well as product returns and channel management in the retail industry. Addressing empirical questions, I employ a combination of cutting-edge **machine learning** (ML) methodologies and established **causal inference** tools.
