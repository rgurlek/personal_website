I am a Ph.D. candidate in Information Systems and Operations Management at Goizueta Business School of Emory University. My research focuses on on developing and applying machine learning tools to tackle data-driven operations questions. My current interests include context-dependent modeling of arrivals and sojourn times in healthcare, as well as product returns and channel management in the retail industry.
