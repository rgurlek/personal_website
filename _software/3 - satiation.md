excerpt: "An interactive demonstration of the procedure proposed in
[R GÃ¼rlek, M Baucells, N Osadchiy](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4648305)
to estimate the satiation in a sequencial enjoyment of experiential goods. Click on the title to read more. <br/> <br/><img src='/images/satiation.png' width = '500'>"

Sequencing of consumption has significant implications for enjoyment of experiential goods and derived ex-post utility due to psychological and physiological effects,
such as satiation, habituation, or memory decay. In [this paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4648305),
we examine the effect of consumption sequencing on ex-ante valuations of bundles, with the goal of increasing consumer surplus and revenue.
See [this web application](https://gurlek.shinyapps.io/satiation_app/) as a demonstration of the estimation procedure.
