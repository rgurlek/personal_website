[Enflasyon Sepetim](https://enflasyon.shinyapps.io/sepetim/) is a web application that enables Turkish consumers, who are mostly sceptic of the official inflation rates and are looking for alternative sources,
to calculate their customized inflation rate. I scrape prices of a wide range of goods from the websites of major grocery stores daily and
the application allows users to specify their basket to calculate their personalized inflation rate.
